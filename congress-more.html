    Global Vision of the
    26th International Women Leaders Congress
  <br>
  (Year of the Women Role Models)
</h4>
<p>
    Woibex, the 26th International women Leaders Congress is one of the most significant international platforms for exchanging experiences and showcasing the achievements of women leaders who have contributed to the development and implementation of best international leadership and institutional practices. It focuses on empowering and nurturing women leaders in modern management science, corporate and leadership governance, knowledge management, and innovation strategies based on global competitiveness standards.
</p>
<p>
    The International women Leaders Congress has achieved both regional and international praise and it is emerging as the largest event showcasing women leaders in the international forums. Over the past quarter of a century, this event has played a vital role in bolstering the foundations of global competitiveness for leadership excellence and enhancing the management of administrative leadership systems to promote the growth of role models and empower women leaders in the Middle East. Through its efforts, Congress has successfully attracted best practices and global competitiveness standards to the Middle East.
</p>
<p>
    In continuation of the vision of the International women Leaders Congress, Datamatix, in cooperation with its international partners from the public and private sectors and with the support of the Middle East Excellence Awards Institute and various media, is honored to announce the Global Vision of Woibex – 26th International Women Leaders Congress 2024, titled: "Year of Women Leaders as Role Models." The congress aims to identify leadership models and empower them to transition into role models and frontline leaders in government and private sector institutions, as well as in the media, and international organizations.
</p>
<p>
    Role model leaders are those who have made significant contributions to leading organizations worldwide, particularly in the context of the modern digital economy. These leaders serve as exceptional examples, showcasing successful executive figures who play a pivotal role in the development of the leadership system and enable their
</p>
<p>
    teams to embrace foresight and shape the future through the latest modern management science systems, institutional creativity, and global competitiveness standards. Their expertise extends to developing sustainability management and governance within organizations, inspiring the next generation of women leaders to take prominent positions in both public and private sector institutions.
</p>
<p>
    These role models are essential in driving positive changes and achieving organizational success. These successful leaders have demonstrated exceptional leadership skills and governance management, adhering to the latest standards of modern management, institutional innovation, and global competitiveness.
</p>
 <p>
    The International women Leaders Congress 2024 aims to highlight such role models who have made significant contributions and served as exemplary leaders. Their successes will be presented to enable other women leaders to learn from their best practices and experiences. The Congress also aims to motivate young women leaders to ascend the ranks of distinguished leadership and emerge as role models themselves within the next 5 years.
